These are "YASnippet":http://yasnippet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/index.html templates for Emacs that aid in doing tasks with "Shoulda":http://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda/tree/master. Shoulda consists of test macros, assertions, and helpers, that are added on to the Test::Unit framework for Ruby. Most of the snippets have been ported from the "Shoulda Textmate Bundle":http://svn.textmate.org/trunk/Review/Bundles/Ruby%20Shoulda.tmbundle/

These snippets assume the use of YASnippet 0.6 or later.
